Textbook
********

* `Generalized Linear Models <http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/dmbook/index.php>`_, McCullagh & Nelder. *Though this is marked as required, I will not follow it too closely. It is a great reference.*

Notes
*****

I will be writing notes as we go, following in part, some of Brad Efron's notes. Notes will include computer examples, and be written in `ipython notebooks <http://ipython.org>`_. The examples will be both in `R` and `python`.

* One parameter exponential families `notebook <restricted/notebooks/One parameter families.ipynb>`_, `pdf <restricted/notebooks/One parameter families.pdf>`_

*************
Prerequisites
*************

Some familiarity with linear algebra and statistical methods.

**************
Topics covered
**************

This is a course on exponential families and generalized linear models. We will cover
the following topics (with some subject to change as we go)

* One parameter exponential families

* Multiparameter exponential families

* Generalized linear models

* Curved exponential families 

* EM algorithm

* Survival analysis (?)

* Additional topics (?)

**********
Evaluation
**********

* homework (about 5 total); 50%
* final exam (according to Stanford calendar: M 6/10 @ 8:30AM); 50%

Final exam
----------

* Following the Stanford `calendar <http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/registrar/spring-exams>`_: Monday, June 10 @ 12:15PM.

* If you cannot take the exam at that time and day, then you will have to take this class in a different quarter. Exceptions will only be made due to official university affairs, such as athletic commitments.
