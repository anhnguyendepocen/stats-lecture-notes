*********************
Computing environment
*********************

We will use `R <http://cran.r-project.org>`_, which you can read about `here <http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html>`_.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

An introductory statistics course, such as STATS 60.

******************
Course description
******************

By the end of the course, students should be able to: 

   * Enter tabular data using `R <http://cran.r-project.org>`_.
   * Plot data using `R <http://cran.r-project.org>`_, to help in exploratory data analysis.
   * Formulate regression models for the data, while understanding some of the limitations and assumptions implicit in using these models.
   * Fit models using `R <http://cran.r-project.org>`_ and interpret the output.
   * Test for associations in a given model.
   * Use diagnostic plots and tests to assess the adequacy of a particular model.
   * Find confidence intervals for the effects of different explanatory variables in the model.
   * Use some basic model selection procedures, as found in `R <http://cran.r-project.org>`_, to find a *best* model in a class of models.
   * Fit simple ANOVA models in `R <http://cran.r-project.org>`_, treating them as special cases of multiple regression models.
   * Fit simple logistic and Poisson regression models.
