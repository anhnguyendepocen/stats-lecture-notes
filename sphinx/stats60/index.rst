Online homework and peer review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part of your assessment will be based on peer review, done through the
`online homework
system <http://stats60.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi/>`__.

Peer review breakdown
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  4% for completing the peer reviews;
-  2% for completing the rating;
-  4% for quality of the reviews.

This last 4% is subjective, but we will glance at the comments you
provided, and take into account students' ratings of your comments and
the accuracy of your scores. Don't worry too much about this; if you are
reasonably diligent about your peer reviews, you should earn at least 3%
and probably 4%.

Homework
--------

-  There will be weekly homework assignments, run through our `online
   system <http://stats60.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi>`__.

-  You may discuss homework problems with other students and with TAs in
   office hours, but you have to prepare the solutions yourself.

-  **As a general rule, we ask students NOT to complete the assignments
   during TAs' in office hours. This will be easier if students do not
   use laptops while in TAs' office hours.**

-  Short answer questions on the homework will be graded by `peer
   review <http://stats60.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi>`__.

-  You must show your work (where necessary) for full credit (on quizzes
   as well).
