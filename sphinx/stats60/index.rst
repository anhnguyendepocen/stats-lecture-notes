Part of your assessment will be based on peer review, done through the
`online homework
system <http://stats60.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi>`__.

Homework
--------

-  There will be weekly homework assignments, run through our `online
   system <http://stats60.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi>`__.

-  You may discuss homework problems with other students and with TAs in
   office hours, but you have to prepare the solutions yourself.

-  **As a general rule, we ask students NOT to complete the assignments
   during TAs' in office hours. This will be easier if students do not
   use laptops while in TAs' office hours.**

-  Short answer questions on the homework will be graded by `peer
   review <http://stats60.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi>`__.

-  You must show your work (where necessary) for full credit (on quizzes
   as well).
