STATS 306B / 191 Notebooks
==========================

This repo collects course material for STATS306B and STATS191,
taught by Jonathan Taylor at Stanford.

The notebooks presume you are running in a certain ipython profile
which is setup in ./profile_stats. Copy this folder to your ~/.ipython
directory and use "--profile=stats" when running these notebooks.

knitr magic
-----------

Besides a custom .css, this profile provides a new cell_magic `%%knitr`
which produces `R` output as if run through `knitr`.
